Version 2.1.2 - February 15, 2012
- Fix for push opt-out analytics

Version 2.1.1 - February 14, 2012
=================================
- Now with Rich Push
- Property files now allow strings in addition to integer values for properties mapped to system constants

Version 2.1.0 - February 7, 2012
================================
- Moved In-App Purchase code from the library to the IAP Sample.

Version 2.0.5 - January 29, 2013
================================
- Fixed incorrect location parameter handling (min update intervals)
- Stop the PushService after GCM registration is complete and all
  additional work has been passed to worker services.
- Updated internal test suite

Version 2.0.4 - January 2, 2013
===============================
- Fixed ExceptionInInitializerError that could arise on firstrun
  using Helium transport
- Sample app PushPreferencesActivity no longer accesses location-related
  preferences if location is not enabled

Version 2.0.3 - December 12, 2012
=================================
- Fixed miscellaneous crashes based on submitted crash reports.
- Format locations in a locale-independent manner.
- Reset the GCM registration ID when the package is replaced (requires addition of
  a PACKAGE_REPLACED filter on GCMPushReceiver).
- Manifest validation is now only performed in development mode.
- Limit API re-registrations (no delta) to once every 24H.
- Applications can now optionally defer calling takeOff with a new 'Autopilot' feature.
  If you have access to the Application class, it is best to continue calling takeOff()
  there, but if you do not (e.g., in an AIR app), this feature will allow your app
  to delegate the takeOff to a class declared in the manifest.
- The library will no longer stop the PushService on shutdown if the transport is GCM (not necessary).

Version 2.0.2 - November 13, 2012
=================================
- Added checks for duplicate messages based on the UA canonical push ID

Version 2.0.1 - October 31, 2012
===============================+
- Fixed a crash issue during push receipt.

Version 2.0.0 RC2 - October 12, 2012
====================================
- Run all GCM registrations in a worker service
- Added validation for new manifest requirements

Version 2.0.0 RC1 - October 1, 2012
===============================
- Added GCM support and removed C2DM support
- Added Rich Push support
- Replaced use of Android shared preferences with a SQL-backed provider. This was done to address
  data corruption issues seen in multi-process applications.
- The library will now print the application's APID to the console even if logging is turned down.
  This allows developers to expose the APID for debugging without logging any other UA information.
- FIX: Addressed an issue with UA API call retries
- Moved the event reporting uploads to an intent service. This will allow developers to decide which
  process will be used for event uploads.
- FIX: The library will no longer attempt to register with the API if a Helium connection cannot be
  established.

Version 1.1.6 - August 29, 2012
===============================
- Catch all exceptions (even unchecked ones) in the Helium connection loop. This is designed to help
  mitigate OS and Carrier/MFR mod bugs like the one addressed in 1.1.5 and an IllegalArgumentException
  reported by a customer that was originating in a low-level OS component.

Version 1.1.5 - August 22, 2012
===============================
- FIXED: Addressed crash in java.net.NetworkInterface. Library will explicitly catch a
  NullPointerException caused by ICS bug. See http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=33661

=============================
- FIXED: Reset backoffTime after successful C2DM registration
- FIXED: Updated the copyright for 2012
- FIXED: Removed logging of app secret in takeOff
- Moved log levels to airshipconfig.properties
- Added a User-Agent to the httpclient
- Added handling for the new boolean return from EmbeddedPushManager.init()
- Added logic to handle when no location providers are available.
- Wrapped db calls in EventDataManager so sqliteexception's won't kill apps.
- Added the application package name to implicitly broadcasted actions.

Version 1.1.3 - May 4, 2012
===========================
- FIXED: issue with location event payload

Version 1.1.2 - May 1, 2012
===========================
- FIXED: incorrect handling of minimum updated time in location preferences
- FIXED: unnecessary starting of location service
- Updated target SDK level of sample apps to API level 9 to address ICS
  notification background rendering issues

=============================
- FIXED: Issues with background location
- FIXED: Issues with no location providers enabled
- Sample App updates

Version 1.1.0 - April 3, 2012
=============================
- Added location collection for Push to Location
- FIXED: C2DM null APIDs will now be regenerated
- FIXED: C2DM deregistration race condition is resolved

Version 1.0.9 - March 1, 2012
=================================
- FIXED: Character encoding bug preventing push registration with Unicode tags

Version 1.0.8 - February 16, 2012
=================================
- FIXED: Hybrid mode now works on the Kindle Fire
- FIXED: Retry inserts to analytics DB when write fails due to DB lock
- FIXED: Connectivity issues following device sleep
- FIXED: Default to a maximum of 40 notifications (from 100). Android allows a given app to post up to 50.
- Added additional analytics data points

- Added an option to wake a wifi-only device periodically to receive notifications

Version 1.0.7 - December 15, 2011
=================================
- FIXED: Crash occurring when UA API registrations were disabled

Version 1.0.6 - December 14, 2011
=================================
- FIXED: Cached Helium server list is no longer removed when the connection is destroyed
- FIXED: Helium connections dropped due to network reachability issues will no longer invalidate the server
- Improved reconnection logic when Android sends multiple connectivity intents
- The Helium server cache TTL is now configurable by the server
- Added a short 3 sec delay after server lookup to allow server-side state to propagate
- Use elapsed realtime clock for heartbeat timer rather than the wall clock

Version 1.0.5
=============
- Improved socket keepalive logic

Version 1.0.4
=============
- StrictMode compatibility for analytics events and com.urbanairship.restcient.*
- Fixed incomptibility between Request.executeAsync and API level 11+ 
- Improved InventoryAdapter and Drawable caching in IAPSample
- Fixed AsyncImageLoader OutOfMemoryException issue
- New PushManager.getApid convenience method

New Features
------------
- Manifest validation for both IAP and Push reports permission, receiver and service
  misconfiguration in the log
- AirshipConfigOptions validation now reports specific errors in the log

Push Changes
------------
- Explicitly log errors when PushService is started before UAirship.takeOff has been called.
- Documented and deprecated PushManager.EXTRA_STRING_EXTRA. Push extras should be sent as a

  had not been registered with PushManager
- Helium now explicitly reports when connections are denied due to billing status

  payload is null or empty. To override this behavior, provide your own implementation of
  PushNotificationBuilder.

  IMarketBillingService.aidl in their source tree)
- Repackaged all Google billing code to prevent conflicts (no action required)
